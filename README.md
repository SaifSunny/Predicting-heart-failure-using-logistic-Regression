# Predicting Heart Failure Using Logistic Regression
This is a project that uses Logistic Regression to predict heart failure in patients. The model was trained using the heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv dataset, which includes several clinical features of patients such as age, anaemia, creatinine phosphokinase, diabetes, ejection fraction, high blood pressure, platelets, serum creatinine, serum sodium, sex, smoking, time, and death event.

The accuracy of the model is 80%, which is a promising result.

# Repository and Data
The project is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/SaifSunny/Predicting-heart-failure-using-logistic-Regression. The heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv data file is included in the repository, and it contains 299 records with 13 features.

#vRequirements
To run this project, you will need the following libraries and software:

1. Python 3
2. NumPy
3. Pandas
4. Scikit-learn
5. Matplotlib
6. Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

# Installation
To install the necessary libraries, run the following command in your terminal:

    pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib jupyterlab

To clone the repository, run the following command in your terminal:

    git clone https://github.com/SaifSunny/Predicting-heart-failure-using-logistic-Regression.git

# Usage
To use the project, open the Jupyter Notebook file named heart-failure-prediction.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

The notebook includes the following sections:

1. Loading the dataset and exploring its features
2. Preprocessing the data and splitting it into training and testing sets
3. Building a Logistic Regression model and training it on the data
4. Evaluating the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
5. Tuning the model's hyperparameters using GridSearchCV
6. Final evaluation of the model on the testing set

# Results
The final model achieved an accuracy of 80% on the testing set. The precision, recall, and F1-score were also calculated, and the results are shown in the Jupyter Notebook.
